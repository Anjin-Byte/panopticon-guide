### **Introduction**

Imagine orchestrating complex scenarios where aircraft, ships, and facilities interact in dynamic and unpredictable environments. What if you could build an intelligent agent capable of navigating these challenges, learning strategies, and optimizing performance in real time? Enter Panopticon, a cutting-edge simulation platform that fuses realism with the flexibility of OpenAI Gym.

In this guide, we'll show you how to unlock the full potential of Panopticon by leveraging its seamless integration with reinforcement learning frameworks like Stable-Baselines3. You'll learn how to create environments, design observation and action spaces, and train agents to master complex scenarios.

Letâ€™s dive in and start building a simple aircraft agent!
