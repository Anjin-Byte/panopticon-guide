# Welcome

Panopticon AI is a web-based software simulation platform compatible with OpenAI Gym. Our project is open source, with code available to military modeling and simulation researchers researchers. We hope to advance the state of the art in military AI research.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a custom training program for intelligent agents using Panopticon's simulation platform and OpenAI's Gymnasium framework. Inspired by the structure of train.py, this guide will take you step-by-step through setting up an environment, defining observation and action spaces, creating reward functions, and integrating with reinforcement learning libraries like Stable-Baselines3. Whether you're building a simple agent or training complex multi-entity behaviors, this tutorial equips you with the tools to design and deploy your own custom training pipeline. Let's dive in and bring your simulation to life!
